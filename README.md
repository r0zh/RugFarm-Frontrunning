# RFF-Analysis (RugFarm-Frontrunning Analysis)

RFF-Analysis is a Python-based framework designed to analyze rugpull farms and assess the profitability of frontrunning them.

## How to Use

### 1. Initial Setup
Create a dedicated folder in rugfarms/ for the rugpull farm you want to analyze. Inside this folder:
- Create a file named `tokens.txt`
- Add the token addresses generated by the rugfarm, one per line.

Example:
```txt
76Jm5U...
HDrdbs...
```

### 2. Fetch Token Data
Currently, the framework focuses on gathering price and transfer data,

#### 2.1. Fetching Price Data
Run the `gather_price_data.py` script:
```bash
python gather_price_data.py
```
The script will:
1. Prompt you to enter the rugfarm folder name.
2. Open cloudflare bypasser
3. Gather price data of each token in the tokens.txt file

Once all tokens have been processed, they will be moved to `processed_tokens.txt` in the same folder.

#### 2.1. Fetching Transfer Data
Run the `gather_transfer_data.py` script:
```bash
python gather_transfer_data.py
```
The script will:
1. Prompt you to enter the rugfarm folder name.
2. Open cloudflare bypasser
3. Gather transfer data of each token in the tokens.txt file

Once all tokens have been processed, they will be moved to `processed_tokens.txt` in the same folder.

## Example Analysis
To test the tool you can test it with any of the rugfarms that I've been following. Suggest st3.
